# Four-Arm Autonomous Room Cleaning Robot

This project integrates multi-arm robotic control, path planning, and real-time obstacle detection using ROS.

## Components:
- **Multi-Arm Control**: Uses inverse kinematics for synchronized movement of four robotic arms.
- **Path Planning**: Optimized cleaning routes with real-time adjustments.
- **Obstacle Detection**: LIDAR and infrared sensors integrated with SLAM for dynamic environment navigation.

## Folders:
- `multi_arm_control/`: Contains code for controlling four robotic arms.
- `path_planning/`: Implements path planning algorithms.
- `obstacle_detection/`: Integrates obstacle detection using LIDAR and infrared sensors.
